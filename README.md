## Connect 3 Readme

The game's objective is for a player to connect 3 tiles in a straight path. 

One player's selected tile is assigned a positive value, and the other's a negative value. Each time a player makes a move, the program calculates the resulting score across the board, and if it determines that any path has the maximum positive or negative score achievable, a winner is determined.
