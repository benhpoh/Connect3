## Connect 3 Readme

The game's objective is for a player to connect 3 tiles in a straight path. 

One player's selected tile is assigned a positive value, and the other's a negative value. Each time a player makes a move, the program calculates the resulting score across the board, and if it determines that any path has the maximum positive or negative score achievable, a winner is determined.

When a player wins, the header color updates to reflect the latest winner, and shakes the board clean for a fresh round to recommence.

One current drawback is that the tile sizes are hardcoded, which may not scale well on smaller screen sizes.
